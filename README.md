# 3xay.github.io

Welcome to my website!
All written in a mix of Markdown, HTML, and CSS.
Probably ~55% Markdown, ~40% HTML, and ~5% CSS.

This is built using [Mkdocs](https://mkdocs.org) to convert the Markdown portions into HTML.
and the [Simple-Blog third-party theme by Fernando Celmer](https://github.com/FernandoCelmer/mkdocs-simple-blog) (but modified a bit).

Fully open-source so you can see how it all works.
Feel free to use this as a template for your own needs.

(The testServer.bat file is for development use only, replace the
Conda environment with yours and the path to the Mkdocs project with yours)

You may have to run the .bat commands manually in Anaconda Prompt if conda isn't recognized as a command in command prompt. (But this should be fixed now)
