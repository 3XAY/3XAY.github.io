# 3xay.github.io - My Personal Website
#### 3XAY (Ayan Bindal)

Welcome to my website!
All written in a mix of Markdown, HTML, and CSS.
Probably ~50% Markdown, ~45% HTML, and ~5% CSS.

This is built using [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org). It's a tool that allows you to quickly build project documentation with Markdown.
Although my website isn't a project, it's kinda like my documentation. I use Markdown (but I've been using a good chunk of HTML lately) to create most of the content on the website.
The beauty of this system is that I can easily and quickly make my website, and then I can use some HTML and CSS later to enhance small portions, creating a nice and simple website
I also use the [Simple-Blog third-party theme by Fernando Celmer](https://github.com/FernandoCelmer/mkdocs-simple-blog) (but modified a bit). It's what it sounds like, a simple theme, designed for readability.
It also features a code-like aesthetic, which was very close to what I was looking for. With some very slight modifications to the css using MkDocs extra css file, I was able to achieve the look I'm going for, and was also able to add animations.

Fully open-source so you can see how it all works.
Feel free to use this as a template for your own needs.

(The testServer.bat file is for development use only, replace the
Conda environment with yours and the path to the Mkdocs project with yours)

You may have to run the .bat commands manually in Anaconda Prompt if conda isn't recognized as a command in command prompt. (But this should be fixed now)
