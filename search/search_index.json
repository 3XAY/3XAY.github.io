I was sitting in my 3rd grade computer lab, learning about technology and all of its amazing uses. It was then that I was inspired to pursue technology. I was at the age where toy robots were fairly basic, but regardless, I loved them. However, I never felt satisfied with what I had, I felt like it could be better. It was then that I discovered the magic of programmable robots. The Micro:Bit was simply amazing, a 5x5 LED matrix, sensors, and microcontroller all packaged into one! With its pins, you could simply slot it into a robotics kit, allowing for even more sensors, lights, and motors. Using that \"toy\", I was able to learn about the basic of programming a robot and microcontroller. It even enabled me to move up from block-based programming to text-based programming. But even this wasn't enough, I needed more. To Competitive Robotics FLL or FIRST Lego League is a robotics competition based off of Lego and EV3 robots. The primary focus of the FIRST foundation is to expose the new generation to STEM and healthy collaboration with teammates. After spending an year in an FLL team, I had learned how to manage a team, build a robot with Lego, program EV3 bricks, and so much more. Then I moved on to FTC or FIRST Tech Challenge. FTC is the same as FLL, except you get a much larger field, more complex tasks, and you have the ability to make a robot from scratch. I joined team 18061, Simply Complex in the PowerPlay season. We built a fairly off-the-shelf robot, but it was great for learning. I learned how to program in Java, the basics of a real robot, and got a chance to use computer vision technologies such as OpenCV. The following year was the CenterStage Season where I took the role of programming lead. That year, we built a fully custom robot, used advanced technologies such as PID, and further honed our robotics skills.","title":"Robotics"},{"location":"Projects/robotics/#robotics","text":"","title":"Robotics"},{"location":"Projects/robotics/#a-3rd-grade-hobby","text":"I was sitting in my 3rd grade computer lab, learning about technology and all of its amazing uses.

Counterspell was a global game jam hosted by Hack Club in over 50 cities! There were over 1,500 participants and more than 600 games were submitted. The purpose was to get teens to meet each other and learn how to create something amazing. The theme was \"You are your own worst enemy\" and it was really interesting to see everyone's interpretation of that. There were 24 and 12 hour events, unfortunately, ours was only 12 hours, but it was still great. Making the Team I woke up at 5:00AM on Nov 23rd, because it was pretty far away, but the day still went really well. We got some Counterspell T-Shirts (I didn't wear it because it was super cold that day). Then, I sat down and waited for Hayden. I've never met him, but we decided to team up on a whim through the Discord server. When he got there, we started talking, and then we saw Ayan and Colin. We'd never met either of them but we decided to ask them to join, so we had a full team. Ayan and I bonded really quickly, at first because we had the same name, but then we realized we had a lot more in common. We both built our PCs that summer, we both have mechanical keyboards, we both prefer Android over iOS, and so much more! I could quickly tell that this was going to be a great team. Theme Reveal At this point in time, we didn't know the theme, but we were joking around with the idea of making a gambling game. When the theme was announced at the opening ceremony , we were ecstatic ! Gambling fits PERFECTLY with the idea that you are your own enemy. After all, you can't stop gambling, but the more you do, the deeper of a hole you dig for yourself. Dividing the Work After we had the theme, we had to make an idea. So along the lines of gambling, we all wrote down a few ideas on a piece of paper and worked together to formulate the perfect game. Hayden suggested Plinko, which we thought would be good, especially considering the 12 hours we have together. Now, Colin wanted to use Godot and we all agreed that we should. After all, the rest of us don't have much experience with game jams (other than Ayan) and he was comfortable in Godot. Then, we quickly realized that we couldn't all work on the same project as the other person, otherwise it would overwrite someone's progress. So, Colin naturally became the programmer, which left Ayan and me with no jobs. Then, Ayan remembered that he can make music, so that's what he did, creating 7 custom original soundtracks for this game based on the storyline. Hayden said he'd do the art (which ISN'T MS Paint by the way) so I was the only one left with nothing else to do. I thought for a while, but decided I'll start writing the README and instructions for the game while I think. That's when I started writing a bit of a backstory, and before you knew it, I had become the storyteller. My job was essentially the creative vision behind the game, which dictated the music and art style. This meant I had to work closely with everyone, and had to manage the team in order to make the game as cohesive as possible. Actually working When it came to actually working, it was really interesting. Everyone had their laptops (except me, with my tablet remoting into my desktop) and it was a fairly small table, so were were all close to each other. I was writing the storyline and dialogue. Every once in a while, I would tell Ayan and Hayden what I added, so they knew what to make next, and they would occasionally ask me to review their work to make sure it all flowed together. Colin used some placeholder assets for a while, until Hayden had enough art made to start adding it to the game. We also decided that we wanted to record the voicelines, not just have them appear on screen. So I decided that Hayden should be the voice actor for the main character and the intro narrator, and I ended up being the voice actor for the devil, and the end narrator. When Hayden was done working, he started scouting other teams to see how far along everyone was (hint: everyone, including us, didn't have enough time). Although I was done with my storyline fairly quickly (maybe a few hours after lunch), my work wasn't over. The team still needed me to explain the storyline for them. Sure, they could've read it themselves, but that would mean spending more time, a resource we didn't have, and could also lead to inconsistencies throughout the game. So my work never ended. (Well, near the end it did when Colin was rushing to implement the million things we kept on adding, but I was on snack + clean-up duty for our table then). Presenting After a long 12 hours, with the occasional food break and guest speaker, it was time to submit our projects. Thankfully, we were assured that we could work on the game afterwards for the global submission. After a few technical difficulties, we got the presentation working, and I think it went well. I started by explaining the game, seeing as I knew the story the best. Then, I passed the mic to Colin, who needed a bit of encouragement to get started, but he did great, explaining how he used Godot to make the game. Next, Ayan explained his many OSTs, and Hayden talked about his NOT MS Paint art. Overall, we had a great presentation, that you can see over here . Global Submissions It was December 1st, 2024. We had a week to perfect our game, and we had finally gotten it to where we wanted it. Colin submitted the submission form at 10:31PM, and we thought that would be it. We didn't really expect to win anything, especially considering we only got 5th place out of 9 teams, but we were hopeful. Then, on December 15th, 9:23PM, I got an email while I was coming home from a party. I opened it and it said that the global voting form is open. I thought, \"cool, lemme send this to the team\" and that was about it. That's when Colin told me that we were in the top 10. I didn't believe it, so I opened the voting form right then and there. I couldn't believe it, our game actually got in the top 10. I was so excited that I ran home, and recorded a video , still in my shirt from the party.","title":"Counterspell"},{"location":"Projects/HackClub/Counterspell/#counterspell","text":"","title":"Counterspell"},{"location":"Projects/HackClub/Counterspell/#what-is-counterspell","text":"Counterspell was a global game jam hosted by Hack Club in over 50 cities!

A macropad is a mini keyboard with only a few keys. (6 in my case). Now, you might be wondering what a keyboard with only 6 keys is good for, and that's a great question! It's not really meant to be used as a standalone keyboard, but WITH your existing keyboard! Now you might be wondering why you would ever need a keyboard for your keyboard. Well, you know how CTRL+C and CTRL+V are copy and paste? There are actually lots of combos like that, and they can be huge timesavers! I personally use them to do things like open Task Manager, switch between tabs, close windows, open tabs in a new window, render in Blender and SO MUCH MORE! The best part about a macropad is that it can do anything you want it to! Need it to do a specific mouse action? Done. Need it to type a long string of words that you use a lot? Done. Need to do a simple key combo? Done! Macropads are such AMAZING tools, so why don't we make one? Step 1: Designing the PCB The very first step is to design the PCB, which was actually my favorite part. I've never actually dealt with PCBs or their designs, so learning that was a challenge at first. Eventually, with some guides and tutorials, I got the hang of KiCad. I made a few revisions (3 revisions to be exact) of my PCB schematic until I got all of the features I wanted. While making the schematic, I found it incredibly relaxing to place a few components down and map each individual trace to each component. The silkscreen on the other hand, was incredibly annoying. After I spent a bunch of time doing the silkscreen, it turns out it was too thin to be printed, so I had to go and redo everything to make sure it was thick enough. The good part, however, is that in the end, I got a fully functional and fairly aesthetic PCB that I was proud of. Step 2: Making the Case I'm personally very comfortable in Blender, which is why that's what I used to make my case. The very first problem I faced was importing the PCB design from KiCad to Blender. It was fairly easy to do in other CAD software, but kinda annoying to do in Blender. Finally, after a lot of research, I found a tool that converted the PCB to a file that could be imported into Blender. It's by 30350n , you should go check it out. The only problem with this tool was that the textures, although super high-quality, were incredibly laggy, so I spent a lot of time making my own textures, which is why it doesn't look great. But after the PCB was fully modeled (thanks to PonderSlime for the 3D models for the parts), it was time to design the actual case. To be honest, I was actually procrastinating a lot because this is the part I got stuck on for my last macropad, so it was a bit scary. Thankfully, I had lots of guides this time, and it was a much simpler design. I started with the bottom, and then used that to make the switch plate and top plate. I had some problems (I didn't make enough holes in the switch plate) and I forgot to make the acrylic 3mm thick, but in the end, I caught all of my errors and was done with the plate. Step 3: Firmware This is the part that I thought would be the easiest, but oh boy was I wrong. Turns out, firmware is hard , like really hard... Because I had a QMK compatible MCU (Microcontroller Unit), I thought it would be smooth sailing from here, but I seemed to have forgotten, that I need to actually set it up. And the worst part, was that my macropad was incredibly weird. Most people have 0 or 1 knobs, I had 3... Most people don't tend to have a screen, I did... And the most important part is most people tend to use matrix wiring, I used direct wiring... (learn about the difference here ). Basically, all of these small problems added up and made it super hard to learn QMK. On top of that, the submission date was almost here and I needed something. I ended up making a custom firmware in CircuitPython, which was pretty rushed.
