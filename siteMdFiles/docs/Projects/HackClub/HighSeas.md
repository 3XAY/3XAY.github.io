### What is High Seas?

High Seas is a general you ship we ship program run by Hack Club. Hack Club is a non-profit organization that has various educational STEAM related activities throughout the year.
These activities are often in the form of a you ship, we ship, which means you, the hacker, ship a project, and Hack Club ships something. (HC has a lot more than just ysws programs btw).

High Seas is special because the you ship part is basically any project you're working on, and the we ship part is also almost anything. 
Need Digikey credits for your next project? You got it.

Need a flipper zero? Why not! High Seas had TONS of prizes for people, helping them create their next project without having to worry about paying for it. Needed a PCB? Just get some PCB manufacturing credits.
Needed a 3D printer? Get the Bambu Lab A1 Mini. Needed some tools? Hack Club had you covered with iFixit, calipers, a Pinecil, and so much more! 


### My Experience
My experience with High Seas was overall fairly positive. It encouraged me to get a lot of pending projects done (like this website, and also this very article with less than 30 minutes before the event ends) and also enabled me to get the basic tools and parts I needed to create other projects in the future.

Sure, there were occasional problems like the website crashing because everyone decided to use it at the exact same time, but those weren't frequent. It was also nice to talk to other people about High Seas, and just programming in general.
One major plus point for Hack Club is the community. Because there isn't any sign-up or payments you need to make, it's a great place to meet tons of talented people.


### Mystic Tavern
I decided to volunteer for this thing called Mystic Tavern. It's an extension to High Seas, where you meet up with other teens near you who also participated in High Seas.
(As I'm writing this, Mystic Tavern is set to happen on Feb 22nd, it's Jan 31st). I saw the message in the Slack saying that we can organize or join meetups near us, and I thought it was a good idea.

Normally, I tend not to actively socialize, but this felt fun. I volunteered to organize my local Mystic Tavern, and we had the date (Feb 22nd, 2025) and time (4-6PM). We also decided on a local pizza place.
[Talk about cool custom t-shirts and DON'T FORGET TO UPDATE THIS WEBSITE AFTER MYSTIC TAVERN].
