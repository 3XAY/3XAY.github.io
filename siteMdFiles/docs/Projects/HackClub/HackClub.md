# Hack Club

Hack Club is a global non-profit, founded by Zach Latta. I found it in 10th grade, and have been doing various projects related to it.
They have "You ship we ship"s all year round, where you submit a project and you get something back in real life! A lot of the things
I've done related to Hack Club are You ship we ships. All projects related to Hack Club will be marked with the <img src="https://3xay.github.io/assets/hc.png"> Hack Club logo, and the appropriate link.
