### About the Channel
I originally started this channel in 2021 during Covid as a Scratch programming channel. It gave me something to do, and it helped me both learn new skills and share my knowledge with everyone.
Occasionally, I would have a video about something else, but it was pretty much just Scratch.
I kept posting till 2022, which is when I took a break from YouTube. I didn't really love the content I was making, and I didn't have much free time on my hands. 

I decided to start the channel
back up in 2024 with a new project idea I had. My channel took a much more different direction, with Devlogs and tech reviews. I enjoy making content like this much more, and I can still spread information.
YouTube has also refined my ability to communicate, edit content, and be more confident overall. If you watch my videos now, you'll notice that each one is better than the last, with a lot more information than other channels,
but *(somewhat)* condensed.
